//! Local VDB snapshot reader.
//!
//! Instead of querying NVD/OSV/EUVD live, a device can match against a snapshot
//! bundle downloaded from a trusted host (see the app's VDB-refresh logic). The
//! bundle groups normalised [`Advisory`] records by **product key** (matching
//! the report buckets), each carrying a `fixed_in` ceiling so version matching
//! reuses the same logic as the live path.
//!
//! This module only *reads* the on-disk snapshot; downloading/refreshing (and
//! removing a stale one) is the app's job. If the file is absent the caller
//! falls back to the public sources, so a missing/garbage snapshot is a no-op.
